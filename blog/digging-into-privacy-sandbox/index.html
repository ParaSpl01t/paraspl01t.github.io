                <h1>Digging into the Privacy Sandbox</h1>
                <p>The Privacy Sandbox is a series of proposals to satisfy third-party use cases without third-party cookies or other tracking mechanisms.</p>
                <p class="time">Tue May 19 2020</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Why does the web use third-party code?</h2>
            <p>Websites use services from other companies to provide analytics, serve video and do lots of other useful stuff. Composability is one of the web&#39;s superpowers.</p>
            <p>Most notably, ads are included in web pages via third-party JavaScript and iframes. Ad views, clicks and conversions are tracked via third-party cookies and scripts. That&#39;s how most of the web is funded.</p>
            <p>The problem is… privacy.</p>
            <h2>The current state of privacy on the web</h2>
            <p>When you visit a website you may not be aware of the third parties involved and what they&#39;re doing with your data. Even publishers and web developers may not understand the entire third-party supply chain.</p>
            <p>Ad targeting, conversion measurement, and other use cases currently rely on establishing stable cross-site identity. Historically this has been done by using third-party cookies, but browsers have begun to restrict access to these cookies. There&#39;s been an increase in the use of other mechanisms for cross-site user tracking, such as covert browser storage, device fingerprinting, and requests for personal information like email addresses.</p>
            <p>This is a dilemma for the web. How can legitimate third-party use cases be supported without enabling users to be tracked across sites?</p>
            <h2>Introducing the Privacy Sandbox</h2>
            <p>The Privacy Sandbox introduces a set of privacy-preserving APIs to accomplish tasks that use tracking today.</p>
            <p>The Privacy Sandbox APIs require web browsers to take on a new role. Rather than working with limited tools and protections, the APIs enable the user&#39;s browser to act on the user&#39;s behalf to ensure that data is never shared without their knowledge and consent. The APIs enable use cases such as ad targeting and conversion measurement, but without revealing individual private and personal information.</p>
            <h2>The Privacy Sandbox proposals</h2>
            <p>In order to successfully transition away from third-party cookies the Privacy Sandbox authors need your support. The proposal explainers need feedback from developers as well as publishers, advertisers, and advertising platforms, to suggest missing use cases and more-private ways to accomplish their goals.</p>
